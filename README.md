checkers

This is an online checkers game built with a Ruby on Rails API back-end and a React front-end. Both two-player and single-player modes are supported. Board states are updated in real time through ActionCable (Rails built-in WebSocket). The single-player mode pits the player against an AI that performs a minimax tree search to decide its next move.

A live version is deployed at http://checkrs.herokuapp.com/
